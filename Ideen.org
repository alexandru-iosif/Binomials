* Dividing out monomials that are units:
> | c-1 ad-1 b^2-1 a^2-1 abe-a |
    c-1  d-a b^2-1 a^2-1  e-b

Here I have used that, modulo the ideal in question, a = a^{-1} 
is a unit, and b = b^{-1} is, too.  This ideal is precisely the 
first ideal
* Compute all "associated lattices"
and send to Laura matusevic
* Make a clear naming convention
for functions acting only on cellular components and others
* Compute the associated primes of a non-cellular binomial ideal
* For Imn compute the monomials, clarify the combinatorial structure !
