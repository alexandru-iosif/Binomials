Study the Cellularity of binomial Quotients.  Currently, discovered in the BPD of component #20 of the ideal of 2x2
adjacent minors of a 5x5 matrix, it seems as if the operation binomial Quotient that is applied in the course of
computing the minimal primary component may not preserve being cellular. Then Algorithm 9.6 is not well defined as it
calls itself recursively while not preserving the necessary condition of the input being cellular.

-- Remove redundant does not work properly as it does not check partial intersections for being contained in other stuff :(

-- Prove: Every cellular ideal has one minimal associated lattice
