\title{Bastard Language from Hell: What is wrong with SINGULAR}
\begin{document}
In this document we collect questions about the SINGULAR programming
language. 

\section{Ideal vs. Standard Bases}
\label{sec:ideal-vs.-standard}

One major mistake when designing Singular was not to implement
seperate types for ideal and standard bases. Many algorithms require
standard bases as input but will still run (and produce wrong results)
if called with an ideal as argument.
