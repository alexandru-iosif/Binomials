* Classes
** Class :Integer Lattice
   Representation of an Integer Lattice as a matrix of vectors
   generating it. 
*** Methods:
**** Saturate() 
     Gives the generators of the saturated lattice, ie. the lattice of
     all integer points in the linear space spanned by the generators.

     Naive algorithm: Compute the orthogonal complement of the
     generators and take the cycles of this matrix. (Does this work
     over characteristic p>0 ?)

** Class: Partial Character
   Represents a partial character over a field K. Contains an integer
   lattice 
   
   Can we just inheret Integer Lattice ?
*** Data:
**** A Lattice
**** A list of non-zero field elements for each generator
