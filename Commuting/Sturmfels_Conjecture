Steps to check the disprove of Sturmfels's Conjecture

bpd.m2 contains a 

-) Check that the intersection actually equals I
Time needed :
-) Check that each component is in fact primary
Can it be done with the classical "isPrimary", or do 
we need "testPrimary" which could have bugs.
-) Check that there are components that are not prime
-) Check whether replacing the components with their associated primes
does not give the same intersection 
(This would indicate a problem in the computation of 
the minimal primary component, right?)
