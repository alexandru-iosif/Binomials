Steps to check the disproof of Sturmfels's Conjecture

bpd.m2 contains a primary decomposition of I23 into 
non-prime components.

-) Check that the intersection actually equals I
Time needed with < 4 GB Memory is up to 6h.
The intersection is checked for potential BPD and Celldecompraw

-) Check that each component is in fact primary
Can it be done with the classical "isPrimary", or do 
we need "testPrimary" which could have bugs.

-) Check that there are components that are not prime
-> Nonsquarefree-Monomials are obvious

-) Check whether replacing the components with their associated primes
does not give the same intersection:
-> It does not. See I23cellIsectRes.m2
